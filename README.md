## [Pizza Shop App](https://pizza-page-effc27fa7d30.herokuapp.com/)

This is a simple pizza shopping page built with React,Material UI, Typescript and Node.js.
## Task 
## Your task
Create the order page for Pluto’s Pizza Shop! Here’s the price list:

- Small pizza (incl. 2 toppings): £6.99
- Medium pizza (incl. 3 toppings): £8.99
- Large pizza (incl. 5 toppings): £11.99
- Extra toppings: £1.49 per topping

Customers should be able to add pizzas to a cart, remove pizzas from their cart, edit pizzas in their cart and finally place an order for all the pizzas in their cart.

The cart should contain an itemised list of everything a customer is ordering, and once an order has been placed, the customer should be taken to a thank you page with their order summary and a unique order number for identification with the driver.

Some customers will also have allergies or special notes! Be sure to include space for that in your application.
